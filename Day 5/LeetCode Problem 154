Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become  [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:

Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
Note:

This is a follow up problem to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array.
Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?


/*
Solved using the binary Seach approach if mid value is greater than rightmost value then search in left part and if less than then search in right part
*/


class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        
        int l=0, r=nums.size()-1;
        int mid = 0;
        while(r >= l){
             mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            if(nums[mid]>nums[r])
                l = mid+1;
            else if(nums[mid]<nums[r])
                r = mid;
            else
                r--;
        }
        return nums[l];
    }
    
};
