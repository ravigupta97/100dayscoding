Given an integer number n, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.
 

Example 1:

Input: n = 234
Output: 15 
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 2 * 3 * 4 = 24 
Sum of digits = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 
Result = 24 - 9 = 15
Example 2:

Input: n = 4421
Output: 21
Explanation: 
Product of digits = 4 * 4 * 2 * 1 = 32 
Sum of digits = 4 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 11 
Result = 32 - 11 = 21
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5







/*
Solved by calculating the product of each number with the other numbers and similarly calculate the sum of all the numbers and then return the difference of product and the sum
*/










class Solution {
public:
    int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int product=1,sum=0,a, b, res;
        while(n!=0){
            a=n%10;
            product=product*a;
            sum+=a;
            b=n/10;
            n=b;
        }
        res = product-sum;
        return res;
    }
};
