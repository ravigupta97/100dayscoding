Given a string and an integer k, you need to reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string. If there are less than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.
Example:
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
Restrictions:
The string consists of lower English letters only.
Length of the given string and k will in the range [1, 10000]


/*
Solved by directly swaping the char at 2k positions
*/


class Solution {
public:
    string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        int i=0, n=s.length();
        while(i<n){
            int j= min(i+k-1, n-1);
            int i1 = j+k+1;
            while(i<j)
                swap(s[i++],s[j--]);
            i = i1;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
