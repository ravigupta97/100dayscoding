Given an array of integers A, a move consists of choosing any A[i], and incrementing it by 1.

Return the least number of moves to make every value in A unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation:  After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
Example 2:

Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation:  After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.
 

Note:

0 <= A.length <= 40000
0 <= A[i] < 40000


/*
Solved by sorting the array and then compare with previous number current should be previous+1
*/



class Solution {
public:
    int minIncrementForUnique(vector<int>& A) {
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        int output = 0, x = 0;
        for(int i=0;i<A.size();i++){
            output += max(x-A[i],0);
            x = max(A[i],x)+1;
        }
        return output;
    }
};
