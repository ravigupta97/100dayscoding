Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes.

Example:

Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 

Note:

There are at least two nodes in this BST.

/*
Solved by using the inorder trraversal which gives the sorted array of the tree and the find the minimum diff
