Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

 

Example 1:

Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
Example 2:

Input: low = 8, high = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
 

Constraints:

0 <= low <= high <= 10^9








/*
Solved by using the approach that make both the values odd i.e. if the value of left is even then make it odd
and if value of high is even make it odd and then calculate the range between low and high
*/









class Solution {
public:
    int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        if(low%2==0) 
            low++;
        if(high%2==0)
            high--;
        return (high-low)/2+1;
    }
};
