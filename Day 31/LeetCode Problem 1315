Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparent.  (A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, if it exists.)

If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return 0.

 

Example 1:



Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is between 1 and 10^4.
The value of nodes is between 1 and 100.





/*
Solved by traversing the tree recursively in depth first manner and adding the value of grandparent node and returning the total sum
