Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

Examples:

s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
 

Note: You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.









/*
Solved by storing all the frequencies of all the characters in the vector and then traverse the vector and find the first non repeating character and return its index

class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        int n = s.length();
        vector<int> frequency(26,0);
        for(int i=0;s[i]!='\0';++i)
            frequency[s[i]-'a'] +=1;
        for(int i=0;s[i]!='\0';++i)
            if(frequency[s[i]-'a']==1)
                return i;
        return -1;
